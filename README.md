An analysis of the NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover webpage links.

## 1.USA.gov dataset

When reading an early preview of [Python of Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) in May 2012, 
I became interested in [1.USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/1usagov.shtml) dataset. 
Whenever anyone shortened a `.gov` or `.mil` link using `bit.ly`,
an entry for this dataset was created. 
Currently they are moving to a new system for data collection,
and the latest available data is for 17 May 2013.
[Hourly snapshots](http://1usagov.measuredvoice.com/) are available for a free download.

When I started digging into the available snapshot files, 
I saw that a lot of links leaded to `nasa.gov`.
